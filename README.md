Different Problems Solved from websites such as:<br>

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms),
- [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/problemset), 
- [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/),
- [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/contests/practice),
- [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/),
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/),
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/problems/school/)

All the platforms have equally level problems on all kind of *Data Structures and Algorithms*, mine personal favourite sites for practicing are **Codeforces**, **Codechef** and **Atcoder**. I occasionaly solve problems from different sites as you will find lesser commits on their folders.

While doing competitive programming problems it is equally as important to participate in **live contests** than just practicing and here my 15-20% of problems been solved during a live contests.
